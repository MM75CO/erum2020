# erum2020

The goal of this folder is to collect a heterogeneous set of material related to **e-Rum2020**, the European R users meeting 2020, that is going to be held as virtual conference from June 17 to June 2020. I am involved in the organization of this virtual conference as member of the [Organizing Committtee](https://2020.erum.io/about/organizers/) and on Friday 19 I will give a lightning talk about the R package ptmixed.
